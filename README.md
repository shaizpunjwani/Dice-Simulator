# Dice-Simulator

Dice Simulator is made on Python language in which we imported some modules and tries to make it more interesting by make 2 functions of dice rolling. Now the exciting part where our game asks the player whether he wanna switch to the other dice where the probability of getting 6 is greater so it gives you upper hand in the game.

#-------Functions----------
class Dice_Sim():
1) Dice(): A simple dice function which works by calling any random number between 1 and 6
2) Cust_Dice(): it works as follows that when the dice brings up the number of it adds the count and then checks if the count is odd so brings up the 6.
-------------
3) Player(): this class calls up the class of dice_sim and takes the input from the user that whether he wanna switch or not if yes then it calls customized dice else runs the traditional dice. It also takes the decision from user that wanna continue or not.

#-------Modules-----------
